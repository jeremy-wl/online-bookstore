Dear <%= @order.name %>,

Thank you for your recent order from The Pragmatic Store.

You ordered the following items:

<%= render @order.line_items -%>

We'll send you a separate e-mail when your order ships.

<!-- When we use this text.erb file, it automatically finds the _line_item.text.erb for rendering; if html.erb, then finds the _line_item.html.erb, as is used in shipped.html.erb -->
